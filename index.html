      <p>
        I am currently a student in the Software Development Bachelor's program
        at BYU-Pathway Worldwide, where I strengthen my technical skills and
        explore new technologies. My coursework has provided me with a solid
        foundation in programming, web development, and software engineering
        principles, allowing me to build scalable and efficient solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond my studies, I am passionate about continuous learning and
        personal growth. I enjoy tackling coding challenges, collaborating on
        projects, and staying up to date with the latest industry trends. My
        goal is to develop innovative applications that enhance user experiences
        and solve real-world problems effectively.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am particularly interested in front-end and back-end development, as
        well as cloud computing and database management. As I advance in my
        academic journey, I am eager to apply my knowledge in professional
        settings, contribute to meaningful projects, and expand my expertise in
        the ever-evolving world of technology.
